# Port-Scanner
Python script for scanning tcp/udp port(s) on a given host

Example:

```
# bl @ bl-arch in ~/projects/learningPython on git:master x [22:53:50] C:148
$ ./network.py
IP Address? 10.1.1.1
Port Number? 80
Port Open

# bl @ bl-arch in ~/projects/learningPython on git:master x [22:54:31]
$ ./network.py
IP Address? 10.1.1.1
Port Number? 69
Port Closed
```

Planning to add:
* Network/Cidr mask
* More than single port
* IPv6
